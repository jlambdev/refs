[Zettelkasten in Obsidian - Artem Kirsanov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6ySG7xYgjY&ab_channel=ArtemKirsanov)

-   Benefits of Zettelkasten system don't increase with complexity
-   How obsidian works & main definitions
    -   Obsidian is a wrapper around plain markdown files
    -   Vault: access to files & associations between them
    -   You don't impose a structure, you let the structure emerge naturally
-   4 folder setup
    -   Zettelkasten: atomic idea notes
    -   Reference notes: used to reference books articles etc.
    -   Files: images / attachments
    -   Templates: container for template notes
-   Setting up
-   Plugins
    -   Be careful not to get lost in the rabbit hole (procrastination)
    -   sliding panes (slide through like they are paper cards)
    -   admonition (good block rendering)
-   Templates
    -   Any note can act as one
    -   Contents of the template will be pasted where the cursor is
    -   Can insert dynamic data like date, title etc. (also be careful about getting lost with this)
-   Creating notes
    -   Ctrl + O; check if the note exists already and add to it
    -   Linking (core concept in Zettelkasten)
-   Tagging and classifying notes
    -   Add tags (dark colour if there is no corresponding file)
-   Maps of Content (MOCs)
    -   When you see lots of atomic content clustering around a certain topic, create a file for it (e.g. Neuroscience)
    -   Serves organisational purposes
-   Start simple and adjust as needed, don't overcomplicate
    -   Start with notes and connect them, see where it goes
