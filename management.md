[Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc)

-   higher rewards (e.g. financial) work well as incentives and lead to better performance for mechanical tasks
-   it leads to worse performance when tasks are complicated / require conceptual or creative thinking (those motivators aren't as directly effective)
-   make sure people are paid enough so the money issue is off the table
-   other motivating factors:
    -   autonomy
    -   mastery
    -   purpose
-   autonomy: desire to be self-directed (also better for engagement)
    -   example of hackathon
-   mastery: urge to get better at stuff
    -   example of people working on open source
-   purpose: organisations have a transcendent purpose
    -   seeking pure profit can lead to outcomes such as poor service
    -   people incentivised to work for organisations that make them and the world better off
